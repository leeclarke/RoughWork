### NOTES ###



//TODO: DESIGN: When building a level editor it might be more efficent for it to save the level map as an image if the level isnt 
//      dynamicly built.Would it work for the maps to be built on the back end by Node.js if they are generated?
//TODO: need to come up with image loader to detect when images are loaded and start rendering. display loading.. thing.
